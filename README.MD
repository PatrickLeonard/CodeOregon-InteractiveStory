## Synopsis

This app is my walk through of the "The Interactive Story" app from Team Treehouse (https://teamtreehouse.com/) via CodeOregon. This was a lot of fun to make and a good learning app for getting user input and moving through different Android activities. It's a simple app, but a lot of fun.

## Motivation

Fun way to learn about Android application development with Android Studio as a part of Code Oregon 1.0, a state partnership between Oregon and Team Treehouse to teach programming skills to Oregon citizens.

## Installation

Recommend importing into Android Studio and doing some testing before deploying.
